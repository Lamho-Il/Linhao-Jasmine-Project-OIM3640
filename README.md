# Project ReadMe - MBTI and Astrological Sign Based Student Pairing System

Team members: Linhao Jiang, Jasmine Zhang

## Big Idea:
  We want to develop a teamweb platform aims to improve the group project experience in educational settings. Leveraging the power of OpenAI, specifically ChatGPT, our application will automate the team formation process based on users' workplace personality types and MBTI assessments. This innovative approach facilitates the creation of balanced and cohesive teams, where each member's strengths and preferences are optimally aligned for collective success. The platform will support different group sizes, allowing teams from 2 to 6 members, providing flexibility for different project needs and classroom settings.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
- A code for users to scan and match with their assigned course.
- A simple, intuitive interface for users to input their workplace personality type and MBTI.
- An algorithm leveraging ChatGPT to suggest team compositions based on the entered data.
- Support for generating teams of various sizes (2 to 6 members), tailored to the requirements of different classroom projects.
 
## Learning Goals

### Shared Learning Goals:

1. To master the process of integrating ChatGPT and other APIs into a web application, focusing on seamless data flow and user experience.
2. To enhance our skills in creating a responsive and interactvie application
3. To develop the ability to manage project from a concept to development. Including planning, experienmnets, and revision based on Professor Li's feedbacks.

### Individual Goal:
1. Jasmine: learn how to effectivly utilize the OpenAI API within a Flask appliction. And enhance my skills in HTML, aiming to create a accessible and user-friendly web page.
2. Linhao: 

## Implementation Plan:

## Project Timeline
### Week 1:
- Start drafting project proposal and schedule
- Set up project repository
- start research on ChatGpt integration and web framwork capbilities

### Week 2:
- Begin front-end development (UI components).
- Start back-end setup (database).

### Week 3:
- Integrate front-end and back-end.
- Implement the compatibility algorithm.
- Begin internal testing and debugging.

### Week 4:
- Conduct extensive testing, including user acceptance testing.
- Make necessary adjustments based on feedback.
- Prepare for project presentation and submission.

## Collaboration Plan:
We plan to meet weekly to discuss our progress, address any challenges, and plan task distribution. We will use Visual Studio Code Live Share during our coding sessions, to enable both of us to edit and debug code simoutanously. 

For day-to-day communication, we will use WeChat for messaging and Slack channels for asking coding related questions. We aim to keep our conversation strightforward and effective. 

For distribution of the work, we ensure that tasks are aligned with each person's strength and learning goals. Linhao and Jasmine helps each other being motivated and productive throughout the process, we all hope to deliver a successful project outcome!

## Risks and Limitations

The most significant risk is the complexity of accurately mapping MBTI and astrological compatibility into a coherent and user-friendly system. Addressing this will require careful research and potentially consulting with psychology and astrology experts.

## Additional Course Content
- Advanced Flask features and best practices to optimize web application performance and scalability.
- Comprehensive API integration techniques to enhance the application's functionality and user experience.
- UX/UI design principles to ensure the application is not only functional but also engaging and straightforward for users.
