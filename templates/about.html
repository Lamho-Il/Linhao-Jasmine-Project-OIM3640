            <h2>The Concept Behind Our System</h2>
            <p>This platform was developed to enhance the way educational groups are formed. Using insights from MBTI
                and astrological signs, our system aims to create balanced teams where members complement each other's
                strengths and weaknesses. This approach is designed to improve collaboration and overall project
                outcomes in educational settings.</p>

            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of our project is to streamline the process of team formation in educational contexts,
                making it both efficient and effective. By integrating personality assessments, we believe that teams
                will be more harmonious and productive. This is part of a broader effort to apply modern technology to
                solve traditional problems in education.</p>
